RULES

BlackJack is a card game that puts the player against the dealer. 

The player makes a bet to start the game. 

Each side is initially dealt two cards.

One round consists of who can get closest to 21 without going over. 

Going over 21 is considered to be a BUST and an automatic loss and the next round begins. 

If player's total value of cards is greater than dealer's, Player wins that round. 

Vice Versa. Dealer win that round.


ORDER

The player is always first to act against the dealer.

Player has to decide whether to HIT (Add one card to your hand) or to STAY.

The player can continue HITTING until they want to STAY. 

Dealer decides the same but must HIT if total value of cards is less than 17.

In the case of a tie, that is considered to be a PUSH (Draw) and the next round begins.
