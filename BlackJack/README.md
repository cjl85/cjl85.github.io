RULES


BlackJack is a card game that puts the player against the dealer. 

The player makes a bet to start the game. 

Each side is initially dealt two cards.

One round consists of who can get closest to 21 without going over. 

Going over 21 is considered to be a BUST and an automatic loss and the next round begins. 

If player's total value of cards is greater than dealer's, Player wins that round. 

Vice Versa. Dealer wins that round.



ORDER


The player is always first to act against the dealer.

Player has to decide whether to HIT (Add one extra card to your hand) or to STAY.

The player can continue HITTING until they want to STAY. 

Dealer decides the same but must HIT if total value of cards is less than 17.

In the case of a tie, that is considered to be a PUSH (Draw) and the next round begins.


MAKING THE GAME

My first two attempts were overcomplicated by my idea that I needed to try to implement

as much as I can about classes, constructors, methods, etc.


Object-oriented. 


Think about the objects you might need first (cards, deck, player, dealer, suits, values, etc)

and figure out how to manipulate and connect them together. 


This led to me thinking about trying to go as simple as possible to make this game.
